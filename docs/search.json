My name is Caitlin Rasbid and I am currently in my third year at Colorado State University double majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and Environmental Sociology. My professional passion lies in the relationship between humans and the environment and the complex interactions between the two that shape the world we live in today. I hope to pursue this passion in a future career in Sustainability Education or Environmental Justice. I would describe myself as a highly motivated critical thinker with an eye for detail. I am excited to see where my passions take me after I graduate and look forward to a career where I can make a positive impact!"

The topic we focused on was how access to outdoor recreational spaces impacts personal wellbeing. This process allowed me to:\n\nDeepen my skills in qualitative research and analysis\n\nIncluding formulating and administering interviews and interpreting responses into a cohesive analysis\n\nStrengthen my ability to write analytically about social science research\nFamiliarize myself with the International Review Board process and requirements\n\nThe report is linked below."
