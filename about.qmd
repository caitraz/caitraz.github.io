Welcome to my professional website! My name is Caitlin Rasbid and I am currently in my third year at Colorado State University double majoring in **Ecosystem Science and Sustainability** and **Environmental Sociology.** My professional passion lies in the relationship between humans and the environment and the complex interactions between the two that shape the world we live in today. I hope to pursue this passion in a future career in **Sustainability Education** or **Environmental Justice**. I would describe myself as a highly motivated critical thinker with an eye for detail. I am excited to see where my passions take me after I graduate and look forward to a career where I can make a positive impact!
